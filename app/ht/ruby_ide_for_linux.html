<h1>Ruby IDE for Linux</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Desktop IDEs are a pain. Ask any developer and they'll tell you they're more trouble than they're worth. Codenvy is the best Ruby IDE for Linux their community can use instead of the outdated counterpart that's so ubiquitous.</p>
<p>With desktop IDEs, developers are responsible for maintaining a great number of components and systems that add no value to their coding time. Unfortunately, a complete code, test, and build environment requires these various pieces, which developers must then administer on their own. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. </p>
<p>Ruby IDEs for Linux manage these time-consuming tasks for developers, thereby removing a significant obstacle preventing them from being truly productive. Ruby IDEs for Linux like Codenvy are changing the way people think about programming. A free Linux IDE that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization can truly be the best friend of a developer looking to improve their ROI on the time they spend working.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<a href="{{'../index.html' | url}}" class="blue-button button-400">Embrace the Best Cloud-Based IDE</a>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
