<h1>AWS Integration IDE</h1>

<hr class="subtitle-line">

<p>Many developers find the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment with desktop IDEs extremely frustrating. When it comes to AWS Integration IDEs, Codenvy is the best alternative for developers who want to leave their frustrations behind.</p>
  <p>Desktop IDEs are essentially miniature data centers operated by developers on their computer. Operating these desktop IDEs takes up valuable time and effort they could otherwise spend programming. A comprehensive code, test, and build environment will normally require the maintaining and running of multiple components and software systems. A recent study revealed that developers may spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE if that is their developing environment. </p>
  <p>AWS Integration IDEs, on the other hand, allow programmers to escape from this drudgery by handling most of these laborious tasks. AWS Integration IDEs like Codenvy let developers spend less time administering their desktops and more time programming. When developers switch to a AWS Integration IDE that gives them greater functionality, flexibility and customization, they can accomplish so much more.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>
