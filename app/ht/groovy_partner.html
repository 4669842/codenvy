<h1>Groovy partner</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Developers often say how taxing the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment with desktop IDEs can be. That is why we developed an alternative. Codenvy is the best Groovy partner for developers to leave those frustrations behind.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are basically miniature data centers developers have to operate. Of course, this takes up valuable time and effort that could otherwise be used to program. To draw an illustration, a full code, test, and build environment usually requires the maintenance and upkeep of manifold mechanisms and software systems, all of which are the responsibility of the developer. A recent study posited that developers spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. </p>
<p>A Groovy partner, on the other hand, frees programmers from all of this tomfoolery by taking care of most of these time-consuming tasks. A Groovy partner like Codenvy lets developers spend less time administering desktops and more time programming, where they want to spent their time in the first place. A Groovy partner that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization is clearly the best solution a developer can choose.
</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
