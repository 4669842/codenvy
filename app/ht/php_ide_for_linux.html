<h1>PHP IDE for Linux</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>We can't help noticing that desktop IDEs cause a uniquely high level of frustration in the average developer. We always recommend Codenvy to these people. Codenvy is the best PHP IDE for Linux people of the coding variety should turn to in order to avoid the issues associated with desktop IDE administration.</p>
<p>Think of it from this perspective: a desktop IDE works like a data center, except on a smaller, individually-scaled level. This means, practically speaking, that developers are responsible for maintaining an active data center simultaneously with their programming responsibilities. Their responsibilities in this situation include the upkeep of multiple components and software systems. Thanks to a study released in April, we now know that the average developer using a desktop IDE can spend up to one-third of their time handling all of the time-consuming tasks associated with desktop IDEs. </p>
<p>PHP IDEs for Linux, are a welcome solution to the conundrum of how to avoid these isses; the answer is simply to code in the cloud. PHP IDEs for Linux (Codenvy numbers among these programming environments) have the capabilities necessary to help developers pay attention to their important coding work and spend a negligible amount of time administering their environment. The many advantages of a free Linux IDE demonstrates that it's clearly the superior choice.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>
