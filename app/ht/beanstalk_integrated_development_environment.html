<h1> Beanstalk Integrated Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Pair programming is basically impossible with desktop IDEs. Codenvy is the best Beanstalk integrated development environment developers can use instead of desktop IDEs to get together and spend time programming with multiple people, instead of just one person at a time.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are severely limited in how collaborative they allow programmers to be. Essentially, they have no capability for it. There's no capability for communication between developers when editing code, no ability to edit the same code simultaneously, and no option to even monitor one another's builds and bugging sessions. And any developer worth his salt is keenly aware of the additional burden desktop IDEs create for developers who are responsible for administering their own development environment. </p>
<p>Beanstalk integrated development environments are nothing like desktop IDEs when it comes to collaborative coding. Beanstalk integrated development environments like Codenvy allow developers to edits the same code at the same time, chat together in real-time to debug and problem solve, and even monitor one another's builds and debugging sessions. As a Beanstalk integrated development environment that allows for an incredible ability to pair together and code away, there's simply no reason not to turn to Codenvy.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
