<h1>Ruby collaboration tool</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>It is easy enough to understand why developers prefer not to work with desktop IDEs, given that they are generally difficult to manage. Codenvy is the best Ruby collaboration tool available on the market that can mitigate the issues of desktop IDEs.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs take up valuable time and energy from developers' tables by virtue of their inherent construction and limitations. A code, test, and build environment with the specifications developers need necessitates a large amount of time spent administering it if it's based on a desktop. This environment can end up requiring the developer to spend nearly one-third of their workweek taking care of ancillary issues.</p>
<p>Ruby collaboration tools replace all that undue anxiety and angst with peace of mind and satisfaction. Ruby collaboration tools like Codenvy can handle the majority of these administrative tasks for developers, saving them valuable time and energy. This is possible because a Ruby collaboration tool like Codenvy manages to be both incredibly convenient and powerfully forward thinking.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>

<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
