 <h1>HTML5 debug tool</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Developers often will demonstrate frustration over the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment with a desktop IDE whenever possible. Codenvy is the best HTML5 debug tool for developers to put those frustrations away.</p>
  <p>Desktop IDEs are basically miniature data centers developers have to operate. They take up valuable time and effort developers could otherwise spend programming. A complete code, test, and build environment usually requires the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. A recent study showed developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. </p>
  <p>An HTML5 debug tool, on the other hand, gives programmers a break from this work. It will handle most of these time-consuming tasks for them. An HTML5 debug tool like Codenvy lets developers spend less time administering their desktops and more time getting work done. Their goals can be achieved by switching to an Online collaboration tool that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization. That tool is Codenvy.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
