 <h1>Java programming IDE</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">

  <p>Often, developers will say how haggard they become over the additional demands on their time that come with having to deal with a desktop IDE. Codenvy is the best Java programming IDE developers can choose instead that will help them get back to their first priority: programming.</p>
  <p>Here is the source of their consternation. Desktop IDEs work like miniature data centers, and developers are forced to operate them on their work time. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. A comprehensive code, test, and build environment usually requires the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems, which all contribute to this high number.</p>
  <p>With a Java programming IDE, however, programmers can put aside these time-consuming tasks to focus on programming. A Java programming IDE like Codenvy lets developers spend less time administering their desktops and more time programming. With Java programming IDE that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization, their goals become that much more attainable.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
