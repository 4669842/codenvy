 <h1>Java sandbox</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">

  <p>Developers will often say they are exasperated by the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment with a desktop IDE. Turning to Codenvy, the best Java sandbox for developers, to leave those frustrations behind is the best decision those developers can make.</p>
  <p>Their frustrations arise from a very understandable place. Having a desktop IDE means that they are responsible for maintaining a small-scale data center, which takes up programming time. A complete code, test, and build environment meas that the developer has to maintain multiple components and software systems. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time taking care of these extra pieces. </p>
  <p>Using a Java sandbox gives programmers unshackles developer because they are no longer responsible for these tasks. With a Java sandbox like Codenvy, developers spend less time administering desktops and more time simply programming. This is the tremendous difference switching to a Java sandbox that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization can give a developer.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>

  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
