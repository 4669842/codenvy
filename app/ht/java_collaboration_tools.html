<h1>Java collaboration tools</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Many developers show a large amount of annoyance over how tough maintaining a development environment with a desktop IDE can be. Codenvy is the best Java collaboration tools for developers to get rid of those annoyances altogether.</p>
  <p>Think of it this way. Desktop IDEs are effectively mini data centers developers have to spend a vast amount of time operating. This act takes up valuable time and effort developers could otherwise spend programming. A full-blown code, test, and build environment usually requires the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. Administering a desktop IDE can take up to one-third of a developerâ€™s time, according to a recent study.</p>
  <p>A Java collaboration tool, on the other hand, gives programmers a break from this work by taking care of time-consuming tasks for them. A Java collaboration tool like Codenvy lets developers get out of the trenches and into the nitty-gritty of programming, where they prefer to be. Their goals can be achieved due to switching to a Java collaboration tools that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
