<h1>Deveo IDE Integration Tool</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>While we're not familiar with the development processes for desktop IDEs, we assume that they don't follow any sort of strict regimen in order to create new releases. Codenvy is the best tool for Deveo IDE Integration because our releases are predictable, with a strict development process that ensures timely and well-structured release calendars.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs aren't just unreliable when it comes to releasing updates and improvements in a timely manner. Because they require maintenance by individual developers, they can suck up a great deal of productive time from a company by virtue of their construction and inception. When combined with their unreliability concerning putting out timely and pertinent improvements, it's no wonder that desktop IDEs are slowly dying out. </p>
<p>Codeplane development environments are better not only because these administrative tasks are taken out of the realm of the programmer's responsibility, but also because they tend to be service-oriented platforms. Codeplane development environments like Codenvy implements each function first as a RESTful Web service, and then the UI is layered on top. With a Codeplane development environment like Codenvy, developers can write macros, applications, and scripts that use these APIs to access and control their Codenvy experience.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
