<h1>ProjectLocker Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Desktop IDEs are quickly becoming a thing of the past due to the fact that they can't be accessed using a browser. Codenvy is the best ProjectLocker development environment that exists in the cloud for developers to finally have their desired development environment â€“ accessible anywhere, anytime, from any console or platform.</p>
<p>A desktop-based IDE is severely limited to the system on which it was created. There's no mobility, no accessibility, beyond the system already in place on the desk or coffee table or whatever surface the developer uses everyday. In the fast-paced world of advanced technology today, there's simply no room for a development environment that can't keep up with the speed of everything going on around it.</p>
<p>ProjectLocker development environments are a standout addition to the browser-accessible IDE world. ProjectLocker development environments like Codenvy can work across a wide range of Web and mobile browsers, including Chrome, Puffin, Firefox, and Mozilla. With all these advantages, it's no wonder that developers at the top of their game are switching to a ProjectLocker development environment: it's simply the better choice available, in every single regard.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>

  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>

<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>
