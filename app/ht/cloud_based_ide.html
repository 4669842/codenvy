<h1>Cloud Based IDE</h1>

<hr class="subtitle-line">

<p>Many developers have expressed frustration over the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment utilizing desktop IDEs. Codenvy is the best web IDE for developers to leave those frustrations behind.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are basically mini data centers that are operated by developers. They require valuable time and effort that could otherwise be spent programming. A full code, test, and build environment usually requires the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. A recent study showed that developers spend up to one-third of their time at work administering their desktop IDE. </p>
<p>Cloud based IDEs, on the other hand, give programmers a break by handling most of these time-consuming tasks. Thanks to cloud based IDEs like Codenvy, developers are able to spend less time administering their desktops and more time programming. They can accomplish this because they switched to a cloud based IDE that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>
