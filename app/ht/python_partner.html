<h1>Python partner</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>A good number of developers have expressed annoyance at how problematic and convoluted maintaining a development environment with desktop IDEs can be. Codenvy is the best Python partner for developers to get around those issues.</p>
<p>Having a miniature data center to operate, which a desktop IDE basically is, takes away valuable time and effort that could elsewise spend programming. A comprehensive code, test, and build environment usually requires the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. A recent study said developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. </p>
<p>A free Javascript IDE, on the other hand, give programmers a break from this work by handling most of these time-consuming tasks. A free Javascript IDE like Codenvy frees developers to get their developing done without sacrificing the importance of their IDE. Switching to a Python partner that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization allows developers to achieve this high level of performance.
</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>
