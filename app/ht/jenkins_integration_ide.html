 <h1>Jenkins Integration IDE</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">

  <p>Programmers the world over have shown their animosity over complexity of maintaining a development environment with a desktop IDE as their environment. Codenvy is obviously the best Jenkins Integration IDE these developers should use to get rid of this animosity.</p>
  <p>Desktop IDEs are basically miniature data centers developers have to operate in order to program. This process takes up essential time and effort that could otherwise be spent programming away. A complete code, test, and build environment usually means the developer must oversee the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. According to a recent study, the average developer can spend up to one-third of his or her time just administering a desktop IDE.</p>
  <p>A Jenkins Integration IDE, which is a welcome alternative to the desktop IDE archetype, handles these time-consuming tasks for developers. A Jenkins Integration IDE like Codenvy lets developers spend their time programming, where their focus belongs. With a Jenkins Integration IDE that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization, itâ€™s hard to go wrong.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>
