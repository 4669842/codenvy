<h1>Java Web IDE</h1>

<hr class="subtitle-line">

<p>Many developers have expressed frustration over the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment utilizing desktop IDEs. Codenvy is the best Java web IDE for developers to leave those frustrations behind.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are basically miniature data centers developers have to operate, which takes up valuable time and effort they could otherwise spend programming. A comprehensive code, test, and build environment usually requires the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. </p>
<p>A Java web IDE, on the other hand, gives programmers a break from this work by handling most of these time-consuming tasks. Java web IDEs like Codenvy let developers spend less time administering their desktops and more time programming. They can accomplish this because they switched to a Java web IDE that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>
