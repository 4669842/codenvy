<h1>Ruby partner</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Many developers have expressed exasperation over the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment that relies on a desktop IDE. I wastes time and energy. Codenvy is the best Ruby partner for developers to leave those frustrations behind.</p>
<p>The time and effort these miniature data centers could otherwise be spent programming. Unfortunately, a full code, test, and build environment usually requires a developer to maintain and upkeep multiple components and software systems. A recent study has shown that they can spend up to one-third of their time working just administering a desktop IDE.</p>
<p>A Ruby partner, a welcome alternative, can handle most of these time-consuming tasks for developers. A Ruby partner like Codenvy frees developers to spend more time programming and less time doing hum-drum maintenance tasks. With a Ruby partner that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization, the game is completely changed.
</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
