<h1>Free Mac IDE</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Desktop IDEs are an inelegant solution to the coding needs of developers, both individuals and teams alike. Codenvy is the best free Mac IDE these men and women can choose to access industry-leading features and controls that help manage the status and accessibility of projects.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs provide a minimal amount of supervisory ability to developer team leads looking to properly administer user privileges. A company with numerous developers find it a hassle to administer access privileges to individual developers, yet often this is necessary to protect sensitive coding projects. Moreover, the amount of time developers can use up just administering their individual desktop IDE makes for an incredibly poor solution to the development environment need.</p>
<p>A free Mac IDE, particularly when it is provisioned through the cloud, can provide these types of access-granting features almost without effort on the part of the administrator. A free Mac IDE, Codenvy being amongst the greatest examples, can provide fine-grained controls over which users have access to each specific project. With a free Mac IDE like Codenvy, developers can see the projects they own and those they have been granted permissions to in a single view. This is just one of many features Codenvy offers which makes it the superior free Mac IDE. </p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
