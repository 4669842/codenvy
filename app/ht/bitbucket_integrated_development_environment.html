<h1> BitBucket Integrated Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>It's tough for developers to manage configurations using a desktop IDE, which also requires a significant sacrifice of time from developers because they require large amounts of time managing and administering things. Codenvy is the best BitBucket integrated development environment that works as an alternative to traditional solutions and provides everything a developer needs to stop worrying and love the code.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are nowhere near where they could be in terms of providing developers with the configuration management options they desperately need to continue moving into the 21st century. Moreover, with a desktop IDE, a developer is also responsible for a truly heinous amount of regulatory work. To maintain an operational desktop IDE, developers have to spend their time with the upkeep of multiple components and software systems. Between this and the lack of evolution toward a configuration management solution, it's unclear why any developer would want to stick with a desktop IDE. </p>
<p>BitBucket integrated development environments go right past the expectations developers commonly have for development environments and change the conversation entirely. A Bitbucket integrated development environment provides, among other things, access to project, workspace, build, and runtime configuration parameters. BitBucket integrated development environments like Codenvy are changing the way developers think about their jobs, and ultimately how the world thinks about systems.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
