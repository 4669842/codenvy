<h1>Gitorious IDE Integration Tool</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Developers dislike using desktop IDEs because they are inflexible and difficult to control and maintain. Codenvy is the best tool for Gitorious IDE Integration that these guys and gals can use to mitigate the issues they often face with desktop IDEs.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs provide little to no support for project management and build frameworks for developers looking to keep projects on schedule. This type of feature would be extremely useful for enterprise clients who must oversee hundreds or even thousands of developers and projects. Sadly, desktop IDEs cannot provide the type of interactivity and easy access necessary to carry out a missive in this capacity.</p>
<p>Tools for Gitorious IDE integration can provide outstanding project management support by virtue of being based in the cloud. Codenvy, a tool for Gitorious IDE Integration at the top of the heap, allows developers to use multi-module projects. With Codenvy, developers can create projects that have multiple artifacts within the project. Maven multi-module projects enable multiple project structures where each artifact is built and managed separately, but under a single project umbrella. With this type of capability, it's no wonder that developers are turning to Codenvy, the clear choice for a tool for Gitorious IDE , without hesitation and with great excitement.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
