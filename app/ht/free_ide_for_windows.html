Codenvy is the best free IDE for Windows available at the moment that can provide cutting edge collaboration features that make teamwork that much more sensible.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are limited in the amount of collaborative access they provide developers. Because they are administered individually on desktops, there are very few options available for teams who want to collaboratively edit and track edits on the same code. Indeed, this type of environment almost encourages errors, overwrites and conflicts. Think about it: if your fellow developer accidentally opens the same file as you and begins to code, reconciling the differences between your code and theirs will be a major headache.</p>
