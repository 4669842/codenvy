<h1>HTML/CSS partner</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>The irritation developers experience at the difficulty and convolution of maintaining a development environment utilizing desktop IDEs is completely understandable. Codenvy is the best HTML/CSS partner for developers to get rid of those irritations.</p>
<p>Let us map it out for you. A desktop IDE functions as a miniature data center operated by developers. As you can imagine, this takes up valuable time and effort that could otherwise be spent programming. A complete code, test, and build environment usually requires the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time taking care of these responsibilities. </p>
<p>A HTML/CSS partner, on the other hand, liberates programmers from this by handling time-consuming tasks for them. A HTML/CSS partner like Codenvy frees developers to concentrate on programming. They can accomplish this because they switched to a HTML/CSS partner that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization.
</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
