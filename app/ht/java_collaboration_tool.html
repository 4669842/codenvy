  <h1>Java collaboration tool</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Many developers have expressed frustration over how unnecessarily complex and difficult maintaining a development environment on a desktop IDE can be. Codenvy is the best Java collaboration tool for developers to leave their frustrations behind and embrace the future of programming.</p>
  <p>Desktop IDEs are basically miniature data centers developers have to operate, taking up valuable time and effort they could otherwise spend programming. The numerous components and software systems in a complete code, test and build environment requires a great deal of maintenance. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. </p>
  <p>A Java collaboration tool, on the other hand, gives programmers a break from this work by handling most of these time-consuming tasks. A Java collaboration tool like Codenvy lets developers spend more time where it counts: programming away. Switching to a Java collaboration tool that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization helps them achieve their goals.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
