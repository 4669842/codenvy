<h1>GitEnterprise Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Desktop IDEs are notorious for the amount of time they can take up haranguing developers and preventing them from getting work done, simply because of the administrative attention they require. Codenvy is the best GitEnterprise development environment available that will not only solve these administrative problems, but also provides a comprehensive back-up system that ensures files are never lost.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs pay little attention to the evolving needs of developers. Having been created as a manner of course at a time when the cloud and its advantages weren't being seriously considered, they come with a severe number of limitations in terms of scope and capability. Not only are they unable to back up data automatically to a cloud database, but the amount of time they require developers to spend administering, installing and maintaining them makes them an outmoded technology in need of being put off to pasture. </p>
<p>GitEnterprise development environments are nothing like their predecessors when they are based in the cloud. GitEnterprise development environments like Codenvy take care of virtually all of the administrative, installation and maintenance needs without the developer's aid, releasing developers from this burden. Not only that, but GitEnterprise development environments like Codenvy place an emphasis on storing client project data and code on clustered file systems. Codenvy, a GitEnterprise development environment, also performs nightly backups. It's just one of the many reasons why developers choose Codenvy as their ideal GitEnterprise development environment.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
