<h1>Gitorious Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Developers are frustrated when faced with the need to work on desktop IDEs. They are tough to administer, and their time constraints b=prevent them from getting work done. Codenvy is the best Gitorious development environment available to the development world that, among others things, can save developers time and offers local library uploads.</p>
<p>A complete code, test, and build environment based on a desktop usually requires overseeing the functions of multiple components and software systems. Without the ability to administer these facts on a large scale, developers are forced to handle these things themselves, without the help of an IT team. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. It's an astonishing statistic that actually isn't all that surprising.</p>
<p>Gitorious development environments, particularly those base din the cloud, like Codenvy, are able to offer far more features, and with far less demand from the individual developers. A key feature of the Gitorious development environment Codenvy is the provision of local library uploads. With Codenvy, developers can upload libraries that are not available in remote repositories, such as JARs, directly into their project. This is just one feature that demonstrates how Codenvy is the best Gitorious development environment</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
