<h1>Rally Dev Integration IDE</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>An integrated development environment based on a desktop creates anxiety in developers. Codenvy is the best Rally Dev Integration IDE they can access today in order to rid themselves of that anxiety.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs will typically demand that a developer spend a significant amount of time looking after their myriad components and software systems. To ensure that their programming environment remains functional, developers can spend up to one-third of their workweek administering their desktop environment. This statistic revealing the absurd time requirements comes from a study conducted this past April.</p>
<p>Rally Dev Integration IDEs provide programmers with a reasonable substitute for a desktop IDE that doesn't ask so much of developers. Rally Dev Integration IDEs like Codenvy can handle the majority of the backend administrative jobs themselves, freeing developers to get back to work. A Rally Dev Integration IDE, based in the cloud, provides all the functionality and flexibility developers need to completely change their workflow.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
