<h1>PHP programming IDE</h1><hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Consider the plight of the lowly developer. When forced to use a desktop IDE for their programming needs, their work burden become unduly strenuous given the exorbitant demands that are placed on them in order to maintain an operational environment. Codenvy is the best PHP programming IDE functioning as an alternative for the traditional use case.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are work like small-scale data centers. Because they are only used by individual programmers in most cases, and because it is impractical to have an external team administer them, the burden falls to the programmer to take care of their coding environment themselves. That means having to maintain and upkeep a full coding environment, complete with its numerous components and software systems. A survey taken of developers working with desktop IDEs indicated that these people can spend up to one-third of their time just administering their coding environment.</p>
<p>PHP programming IDEs, cloud-based programming environments, subvert the expectation that a programming environment requires burdensome maintenance on behalf of the programmer. PHP programming IDEs like Codenvy can handle the lion's share of these issues themselves by taking care of the maintenance issues behind the scenes. With a PHP programming IDE, developers have a near limitless capacity to increase their productivity and erase their distracting maintenance duties.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
