      any, are set forth in Codenvy's pricing schedule located at <a
href="pricing">http://codenvy.com/pricing</a>. Codenvy shall
      have the right to change fees any time.</p>
    <p>(b) <u>Invoices and Payment</u>. Codenvy shall, if applicable, invoice
      Customer in advance at the beginning of each calendar month during a
      Subscription Term for Subscription Fees. All payments must be made in U.S. dollars within thirty (30) days of the

      payments may be subject to a monthly charge of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per
      month, or the highest rate allowed by applicable law, whichever is lower.</p>
    <p>(c) <u>Early Termination</u>. Customer
      understands and agrees that the Subscription Fee for the applicable
      Subscription is based on Customer's agreement to pay such Subscription Fee for
      the entire Subscription Term. Accordingly, and without limiting any
      other remedy that may be available to Codenvy hereunder, at law or in equity,
      Customer agrees that in the event this Agreement is terminated by Codenvy for
      Customer's breach, or in the event that Customer terminates this Agreement
      other than in accordance with its terms, all Subscription Fees due under this
      Agreement for the remaining part of the Subscription Term, shall immediately
      become due and payable upon any such termination of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>(d) <u>Taxes.</u> All
      amounts payable by Customer to Codenvy under this Agreement are exclusive of
      any tax, levy or similar governmental charge that may be assessed by any

      execution or performance of this Agreement, and including without limitation
      all sales, use, excise, import or export, value added, governmental permit

      by the United States or any state thereof. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>2.10 <u>Confidential Information</u>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(a) <u>Confidential Information</u>. &quot;Confidential Information&quot; means (i) in the case of Customer, only
      Customer Content contained in Private Projects and (ii) in the case of Codenvy,
      any non-public information provided by Codenvy under this Agreement in any form or format, including
      without limitation, technical, business, financial and marketing information,
      and descriptions of the existence or state of progress of that
      information. Codenvy's Confidential
      Information includes, without limitation, any and all copies, notes, analyses,
      compilations, studies, interpretations, and summaries of that information
      prepared by or for Customer. The Service and all features and functions
      therein shall be the Confidential Information of Codenvy. Confidential
      Information entitled to protection under this Agreement may be disclosed in a tangible
      or intangible format and must be marked as &quot;confidential&quot; or with a similar
      legend, or if information is disclosed solely by oral or visual means, it must
      be identified as confidential at the time of disclosure. Failure to mark or designate information
      as &quot;Confidential Information&quot; at the time of disclosure, shall not relieve
      Recipient of its obligations hereunder if the nature of the information and/or
      the circumstances of disclosure are such that Recipient knew or should have
      known the information was &quot;Confidential Information&quot;.</p>
    <p>(b) <u>Non-use and Non-disclosure</u>. The party receiving
      Confidential Information (the &quot;<u>Recipient</u>&quot;) shall not use the
      Confidential Information other than for the performance of this Agreement. Recipient shall keep the other party's (&quot;<u>Discloser</u>&quot;)
      Confidential Information in strict confidence. Recipient shall only disclose
      Confidential Information to its employees, including its temporary workers
      provided by a staffing agency and independent contractors, that are under
      Recipient's direct supervision and control, having: (i) a need to know that
      information to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, and (ii) agreed in
      writing to non-disclosure obligations at least as restrictive as those in this
      Agreement. Recipient may disclose the other party's
      Confidential Information to its contracted suppliers under confidentiality
      terms on a need to know basis to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement. Recipient
      shall protect the Discloser's Confidential Information with at least the same degree
      of care Recipient uses to protect its own confidential information of like
      importance, but never using less than a reasonable standard of care.</p>
    <p>(c) <u>Exclusions</u>. Confidential Information does not
      include any information that: (i) was already known through lawful means by
      Recipient without an obligation of confidentiality before disclosure under this
      Agreement as evidenced by written records predating the disclosure; (ii) is
      readily accessible to the public on or after the date of disclosure other than
      through Recipient's breach of this Agreement; (iii) was rightfully received by
      Recipient without restriction on disclosure from a third party entitled to make
      such a disclosure (except that this exception applies only after Recipient
      receives the information from the third party); (iv) was independently
      developed by Recipient without using any of Discloser's Confidential
      Information as directly evidenced by Recipient's written records; or (v) is
      approved for release or disclosure by written authorization of the Discloser.</p>
    <p>(d) <u>Disclosure Required by Law</u>. Recipient may
      comply with an order from a court or other governmental body of competent
      jurisdiction and disclose the other party's Confidential Information in
      compliance with that order provided that Recipient shall: (i) give the
      Discloser prior notice of such disclosure if the time between that order and
      such disclosure reasonably permits or, if time does not permit, gives the
      Discloser notice of such disclosure promptly after complying with that order
      and (ii) fully cooperate with the Discloser, at the Discloser's cost and
      expense, in seeking a protective order, confidential treatment, or taking other
      measures to oppose or limit such disclosure. Recipient must not release any
      more of the Discloser's Confidential Information than is, in Recipient's good
      faith judgment, reasonably necessary to comply with that order.</p>
    <p>(e)  <u>Retention of Rights; Return of Confidential Information</u>. Discloser retains full ownership of all disclosed
      information, including Confidential Information. Except for Recipient's limited
      right to use Confidential Information as set forth in this Agreement, no
      license or rights, either express or implied, are granted under this Agreement,
      including without limitation, any intellectual property rights. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement
      or Discloser's written request, Recipient shall immediately: (i)cease
      using all of Discloser's Confidential
      Information, and (ii) return or destroy all copies of Discloser's Confidential
      Information held or controlled by Recipient in tangible form, or if stored
      electronically, shall destroy or erase all such Confidential Information so
      stored, unless it has been archived on electronic backup media. Upon Discloser's request, Recipient
      shall certify to Discloser in writing that Recipient has fully complied with
      its obligations under this Section2.10(e).</p>

  <p>2.11 <u>Subscription Terms and Termination</u>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(a) <u>Subscription Term.</u> Each Subscription shall become effective
      on the date Customer orders the same, and shall, unless earlier terminated in
      accordance with the terms hereof, remain in effect for the applicable
      Subscription Term.</p>
    <p>(b) <u>Termination for Cause.</u> In
      the event that Customer breaches this Agreement, any then-current Subscription
      shall immediately and automatically terminate. </p>
    <p>(c) <u>Effect of Termination or
      Expiration of a Subscription.</u> In
      the event of the termination of a Subscription for any reason, or expiration of
      a Subscription Term, Customer's right to access and use the Service shall
      immediately terminate. All terms of
      this Agreement that contemplate continued performance or forbearance by either
      party, along with the obligation to pay any amounts, shall survive any such expiration
      or termination, including Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2.5, 2.8(f), 2.9, 2.10, 2.11(c),
      2.11(d), 3, 4 and 5.</p>
