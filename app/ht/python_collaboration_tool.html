<h1>Python collaboration tool</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>You'd be surprised by how many developers are fed up with how cantankerous and shifty their desktop IDE can be, and how much stress and frustration that can induce. Codenvy is the best Python collaboration tool, we tell developers, that they can use to avoid these costly pitfalls and get back to their job.</p>
<p>Consider the following. Desktop IDEs must have the complete array of components and software systems a developer needs in order to get their job done. These additional features require an enormous amount of time and energy to upkeep, time that must be taken away from the developer. We now know, thanks to a study conducted this spring, that developers can spend anywhere up to one-third of their workweek just administering their desktop programming environment. </p>
<p>Python collaboration tools make their mark on the development world by altering the expectations long held for what can be accomplished in a developing environment. Python collaboration tools take care of the majority of back-end administrative issues themselves, giving developers an opportunity to concentrate on coding. These goals and aspirations are attainable just by switching to a Python collaboration tool that provides an astronomical increase in the amount of time and energy programmers are able to give to their real work: writing code</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
