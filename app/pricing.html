                <h3>What is a workspace?</h3>
                <p>A workspace is the logical collection of projects, code, IDEs, builders, and runners that an account has access to. A workspace has an identified, registered user that owns the workspace and for which you will pay the applicable fee.</p>

                <h3>What is a developer?</h3>
                <p>Developers are other Codenvy users that you have given write access to one or more projects residing in your workspace. It is possible for a named workspace to have unlimited number of developers sharing the workspace. There is no fee for adding developers into your workspace.</p>

                <h3>What is the difference between a developer and a workspace?</h3>
                <p>The workspace is the logical collection of projects and is administered by an account owner or their designated authority. Developers are the users who perform activity within the workspace. We encourage you to invite as many developers into your workspace as youâ€™d like. We are able to provide this ability by limiting the build and run activity by assigning a fixed number of queues to the workspace. Increasing the number of developers does not increase the queue count.</p>

                <h3>What horsepower do I get with a queue?</h3>
                <p>Builder queues come with 1.0 GHz of horsepower running on a single core. Shared runner queues come with 256MB of memory running with 2.0 GHz of horsepower on a single core while dedicated runner queues are allocated 1024MB of memory running with 2.0 GHz of horsepower on a single core. Customers can request queues with more memory and CPU.  Feel free to contact us to discuss your needs.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="span6">
                <h3>What is the difference between a shared queue and a dedicated queue?</h3>
                <p>Shared queues are those that exist in a pool used by the global Codenvy community. Generally, we keep the pool large enough to support all users, but in times of peak traffic, some workspaces have their build and run requests queued waiting for available resources. Shared queues have their builds capped at 30 seconds and their runs capped at 5 minutes.<br>A dedicated queue is one that only exists for use by the named developer workspace.  While a named developer workspace can have many collaborators within the workspace simultaneously working on different projects, all of that activity will be regulated by the number of dedicated queues allocated to the workspace.  Dedicated queues have their builds capped at 10 minutes and runs capped at 30 minutes.</p>
                
                <h3>What is a public project?</h3>
                <p>A pubic project is viewable by anyone. Codenvy publishes all public projects on our Web site through a standard project URL.  Anonymous users and Codenvy registered users will have read access to these projects, can view their contents, and copy their contents into their own workspace. A developer is another Codenvy user that you have given write access to the project.</p>
                
                <h3>What is a private project?</h3>
                <p>A private project is viewable only by Codenvy users that have been granted read, write, or administrative privileges to that project. By default, only the  project owner has  read and write privileges. Private projects also have a standard project URL. Users must be authenticated Codenvy users and hold the appropriate authorizations to gain access to a private project.</p>
