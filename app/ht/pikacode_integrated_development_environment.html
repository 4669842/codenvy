<h1>PikaCode Integrated Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Pair programming is basically impossible with desktop IDEs. Codenvy is the best PikaCode integrated development environment developers can use instead of desktop IDEs to join forces and spend time programming with multiple people, instead of only being able to collaborate one on one.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are rigorously limited in how cooperative programmers can be when using them. Essentially, they have no capacity for it. There's no capability for communication between developers when working on applications together, no ability to edit the same files at the same time, and no option to even monitor one another's builds and bugging sessions. Any developer with a modicum of experience is keenly aware of the additional burden desktop IDEs create through forcing developers to administer their own development environment. </p>
<p>PikaCode integrated development environments are nothing like desktop IDEs when it comes to collaborative coding. PikaCode integrated development environments like Codenvy allow developers to edits the same code at the same time, chat together in real-time to debug and solve problems, and even monitor one another's builds and debugging sessions. As a PikaCode integrated development environment that allows for an incredible ability to join forces and program like there's no tomorrow, there's simply no reason not to choose Codenvy.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
