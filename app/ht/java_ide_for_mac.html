<h1>Java IDE for Mac</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">

 <p>A desktop IDE requires difficult and complex maintenance, which often will end up frustrating developers. Codenvy is the best Java IDE for Mac for developers to leave those frustrations behind.</p>
  <p>From their perspective, desktop IDEs work like miniature data centers they must operate in order to do their job. It is apparent that this ends up taking up valuable time and effort they could otherwise spend programming. The myriad components and software systems of a full-scale code, test, and build environment usually requires a large amount of maintenance time. Up to one-third of a developers time can be spent administering their desktop IDE. This statistic is from a recent study.</p>
  <p>A Java IDE for Mac, on the other hand, gives programmers a break from this work by handling most of these time-consuming tasks. A Java IDE for Mac like Codenvy lets developers use more time programming and use less of their time taking care of this tedious task. A Free Mac IDE like Codenvy can help them achieve these high-level aspirations.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
