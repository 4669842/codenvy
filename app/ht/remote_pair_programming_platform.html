<h1>Remote pair programming platform</h1>

<hr class="subtitle-line">

<p>Many developers have expressed frustration over the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment utilizing desktop IDEs. Codenvy is the best Remote pair programming platform for developers to get rid of those frustrations.</p>

<p>Desktop IDEs are essentially small-scale data centers operated by developers, which takes up valuable time and effort that could otherwise be spent programming. A comprehensive code, test, and build environment usually demands the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. A recent study has shown that developers spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. </p>

<p>Remote pair programming platforms, on the other hand, give programmers a break from this work by handling most of these time-consuming tasks. Remote pair programming platforms like Codenvy let developers spend less time administering their desktops and more time programming. They can accomplish this because they switched to a Remote pair programming platform that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization.</p>

<h2>Remote pair programming platform</h2><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
