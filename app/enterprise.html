		<p>Has configuring and managing developer environments across your organization become a compliance risk and costly activity?</p>

		<p>A centrally-managed development environment solves many thorny issues related to IP drift, provisioning new projects, and IDE configuration.</p>

		<p>Codenvy Enterprise is a private cloud version of Codenvy, installed and managed behind your firewall.  Your organization can centrally manage teams, coders, and administrators. Development teams connect through their browser and gain access to all of Codenvy’s features including CVS integration, PaaS bindings, editing, and real-time collaboration. Codenvy Enterprise provides mechanisms to independently scale the editing, build, and test VMs allocated to projects enabling administrators to determine the resources allocated to an individual or team.</p>

		<h3>Features:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Installable version of Codenvy</li>
			<li>Centralized coder, team, and project management</li>
			<li>Centralized monitoring and control of IP – no code copied on developer desktops</li>
			<li>Independent scaling of VMs for editing, build, and test</li>
			<li>Add-ons for Codenvy-supported CVS and PaaS providers included</li>
		</ul>
