<h1>GitHub Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Many developers are fed up with the lack of flexibility and functionality that desktop IDEs are known for, and express their concern that this field is not evolving quickly enough. We beg to differ. Codenvy is the best cloud-based GitHub development environment developers can use that offers novel and exciting features like an integrated build system.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs eat away at the time developers spend doing their jobs by requiring a substantial amount of administrative and maintenance time. Logistically, this makes sense. A full-scale code, test, and build environment based on a desktop requires the maintenance of a large number of components and software systems. This additional work can mean that a developer is only able to spend two-third of their workweek actually getting programming work finished. Coupled with the lack of innovation in the desktop IDE sphere, it's no wonder that developers are beginning to look elsewhere for their programming solutions.</p>
<p>A GitHub development environment based in the cloud can accomplish a great deal more than a desktop IDE, simply by virtue of the expanded reach and capabilities at their fingertips. A GitHub development environment like Codenvy has an integrated, dependency-based maven build manager to structure compilation, libraries, unit tests, and packaging. With Codenvy, an outstanding GitHub development environment and alternative to desktop IDEs, developers can configure their own build sequences and even reuse libraries from Maven Central.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
