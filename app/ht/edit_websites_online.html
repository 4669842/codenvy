	<h1>Edit Websites Online</h1>

	<hr class="subtitle-line">

	<p>Codenvy addresses multiple needs in the end-to-end cloud development
	workflow, including the ability edit websites online.  But developers virtually "live" in the editor/IDE, so having
	a complete and powerful Online HTML and CSS Editor (in addition to multiple other web languages) is essential to project success.
	</p>
	<p>The Codenvy Online HTML Editor knows HTML and CSS syntax, formatting and language
		nuances.  The Online HTML IDE allows web developers to edit websites online and supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously.
		
		Our complete HTML/CSS IDE revolutionize technical workbenches by leveraging cloudâ€™s collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.  We strive for simplicity, efficiency and productivity.
	</p>
	<p>In fact, the Codenvy Online IDE is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it
	for all our own in-house development.  i.e, Codenvy is written using the Codenvy IDE.
