<h1>PHPCloud Integrated Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Being forced to use desktop IDEs cannot be proven to cause unfortunate side effects in developers, but it has been known to cause undue amounts of stress and anxiety. Codenvy is the best PHPCloud integrated development environment at the disposal of the development community that affords them ability to pretend desktop IDEs no longer exist.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs take up valuable time and effort developers could otherwise spend creating or managing applications. A comprehensive code, test, and build environment usually requires the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. Using a desktop IDE in this manner can take al the joy out of programming. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. </p>
<p>PHPCloud integrated development environments are nowhere near as time-consuming, and, more than that, also provide a number of features that desktop IDEs can't or won't deliver. For example, Codenvy, a leading PHPCloud integrated development environment, will autosave files for developers. Additionally, this exceptional PHPCloud integrated development environment incorporates algorithms to automatically detect file and project types when they are imported into Codenvy. A PHPCloud integrated development environment like Codenvy just makes infinitely more sense than any desktop alternative.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
