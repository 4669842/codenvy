<h1>Cloud IDE for Java</h1>

<hr class="subtitle-line">

<p>A number of developers express concern over the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a Java development environment utilizing desktop IDEs. Codenvy is the best cloud IDE for Java for developers to leave those frustrations behind.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are basically mini data centers that are operated by developers, requiring valuable time and effort that could be spent programming. A complete code, test, and build environment most often requires the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. </p>
<p>Cloud IDEs for Java, on the other hand, give programmers a break from this work by handling most of these time-consuming tasks. Thanks to cloud IDEs for Java like Codenvy, developers are able to spend less time administering their desktops, and more time programming. All because they switched to a cloud IDE for Java that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
