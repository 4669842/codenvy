	<h1>Online Java IDE</h1>

	<hr class="subtitle-line">

	<p>Many developers have expressed frustration over the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment utilizing desktop IDEs. Codenvy is the best online Java IDE for developers to leave those frustrations behind.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are effectively miniature data centers developers have to operate. This takes up time and effort they could otherwise spend programming. Full code, test, and build environments usually require maintaining numerous components and software systems. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. </p>
<p>Online Java IDEs, on the other hand, give programmers a break from this work by handling most of these time-consuming tasks. Online Java IDEs like Codenvy let developers spend less time administering their desktops and more time programming. An Online Java IDE provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization, which helps developers accomplish these goals.</p>
<p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
