 <h1>Github Integration IDE</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Developers often say how frustrated they are over the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment that is based in a desktop IDE. Codenvy is the best Github Integration IDE for developers to bypass those frustrations.</p>
  <p>Desktop IDEs are basically miniature data centers developers are forced to operate, taking valuable time and effort that could otherwise be used to programming. A comprehensive code, test, and build environment typically requires maintenance and upkeep of many components and software systems. As a recent study revealed, developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering a desktop IDE. </p>
  <p>A Github Integration IDE is a wlecome alternative to this model. It gives programmers a break from this work by handling most of these time-consuming tasks. A Github Integration IDE like Codenvy lets developers spend less time administering their desktops and more time getting work done. Their goals can be achieved due to switching to a Github Integration IDE that gives them greater functionality, flexibility and customization.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>
