<h1>Deveo Integrated Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>In the world of developers, there are few things that can create more frenzy than a discussion of the drawbacks of desktop IDEs. Their clumsiness, as well as their inability to provision enough space and power for individual tasks, makes them a disappointing solution to the IDE need. Codenvy is the best Deveo integrated development environment for these men and women to use because it is an auto-scaling platform.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are a disappointing solution for a variety of reasons, the least of which is their inability to cope with the increasing modernity and innovation in the technological world. The obscene amount of time and energy these types of environments necessitate in order to operate properly has pushed members of the development community to create other, better solutions. With developers spending one-third of their workweek just operating their desktop IDE, it's no wonder companies began pushing into this sphere.</p>
<p>Deveo integrated development environments are one such innovative product that are beginning to change the way people think about coding. Deveo integrated development environments like Codenvy are based in the cloud and come with less administrative tasks for developers, but that's not their only advantage. Deveo integrated development environments like Codenvy can run separate lusters of hardware for IDEs, builders, and runner. Each cluster is independently and automatically scaled to provide maximum power to each task. This provisioning is capable only through an advanced Deveo integrated development environment that can support this type of innovative feature.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
