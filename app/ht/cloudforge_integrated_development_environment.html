<h1> CloudForge Integrated Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>The idea of automated maintenance with a desktop IDE is so far-fetched, you might actually have a developer laugh in your face at the mere mention of such a wild though. Codenvy is the best CloudForge integrated development environment precisely because it doesn't take things like automated and seamless upgrades and maintenance for granted.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs have notoriety precisely because so much of their maintenance requires the work of the individual developer. Consider, if you will, the many issues that developers can also run into when trying to maintain their complex desktop programming environment. Anything from failed installations to flawed plugins and buggy add-ons can completely wreck a desktop IDE for hours, leaving a developer helpless and with no choice but to spend their time figuring out how to solve the problem. It's definitely not a good look on them.</p>
<p>CloudForge integrated development environments are automatically maintained in the cloud, meaning that there's little to nothing a developer has to do to keep working. Upgrades with CloudForge integrated development environments like Codenvy are automated and seamless, frequent and, best of all require no space or effort from developers. A CloudForge integrated development environment like Codenvy secures code, projects and data through the process of maintenance and upgrades, and ensures that maintenance windows are minimal.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>

  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
