<h1> Codespaces Integrated Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Providers and implementers of desktop IDEs are rarely invested in the success of their users. For example, Eclipse can take years to fix a bug that affects virtually every user in their ecosystem. Codenvy is the best Codespaces integrated development environment available on the market precisely because we believe our success is intrinsically related to our users' success.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs like Eclipse are notorious for being both unwieldy to manage and untrustworthy in putting out regular updates that address the general needs of their user base. Moreover, a great deal of the content users will take advantage of when learning a new system is developed not by the provider of the desktop IDE, but by other users who have learned the interface by trial and error. This far from an ideal situation for developers who may need the insight of the person behind the scenes in order to fix issues.</p>
<p>Codespaces integrated development environments that are based in the cloud typically will have more in-depth user tutorials and documentation resources than their desktop counterparts. Codespaces integrated development environments like Codenvy provide a complete reference guide on how to use Codenvy properly, as well as an exhaustive collection of tutorials and how-tos in multiple formats across a range of project A Codespaces integrated development environment like Codenvy can completely revolutionize how people approach development by simply being proactive in helping their users figure out how to utilize their tools effectively.</p>
