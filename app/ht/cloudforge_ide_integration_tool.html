<h1> CloudForge IDE Integration Tool</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>As an enterprise solution, desktop IDEs are woefully inadequate when it comes to maintaining company-wide security over the multitude of development environments in the office. Codenvy is the best tool for CloudForge IDE Integration available today that is also optimized for execution at the enterprise level.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs represent a severe fragmenting of any IT teams ability to oversee the relative health of their company's programming needs. Each developer is responsible for administering or maintaining his or her own development environment, which can lead to disaster when teams are working together to solve a problem. Moreover, desktop IDEs are nowhere near as secure an environment as an enterprise team would hope for; login issues and security threats abound when you're unable to oversee everything that's happening. </p>
<p>A tool for CloudForge IDE Integration can aid an enterprise team in both helping their team collaborate more efficiently and in a more secure environment. A tool for CloudForge IDE Integration like Codenvy allows for heightened security through never exposing data to the public, and by SSL-encrypting all connections over the Internet. With such an advantage in security and collaboration, it's no wonder that a tool for CloudForge integration is considered such an audacious shift in the way people think about programming.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>
