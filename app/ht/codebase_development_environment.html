<h1> Codebase Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>No one would ever rightly suggest that programmers use a desktop IDE to maintain the utmost levels of security and compliance when dealing with things like medical records or payment information. Codenvy is the best Codebase development environment because its compliance standards make it easy for developers to comply with information security standards and regulations.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs vary wildly from one to another, but being able to achieve a high level of security necessary for governmental compliance standards is difficult for any one of them. There are such disparate approaches developer can take to ensuring the upkeep of their coding environments that it's a wonder they would even try to achieve compliance at all. There's simply no way to guarantee that a desktop IDE's security protocols will be able to uphold the high standards set by governmental regulation. </p>
<p>Codebase development environments like Codenvy come with an industry-leading ability to conform to strict security standards across an entire enterprise team without the bother of overseeing developer's individual coding environments. Codebase development environments, specifically Codenvy, can easily comply with information security standards and regulations, including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), and Payment Car Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).  These types of things make Codenvy, a Codebase development environment at the head of its class, an outstanding tool for enterprise teams to use in lieu of traditional solutions.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>

  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
