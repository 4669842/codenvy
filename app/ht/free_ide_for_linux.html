<h1>Free IDE for Linux</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Some developers are hesitant to switch from desktop IDEs to cloud-based IDEs because of the security or sharing issues that may arise. Codenvy is the best free IDE for Linux on the market in part because its workspace privacy settings are top of the line and amenable to whatever a developer wants.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs in and of themselves are fast becoming obsolete. This is not in the least because they require developers to administer multiple components and software systems by themselves on their programming platform. This leaves the developer with approximate two-thirds of the time he or she should have to program, a sorry statistic. Moreover, the sharing capabilities of desktop IDEs are laughably limited.</p>
<p>A free IDE for Linux manages to provide the flexibility of a cloud-based solution, as well as the sharing capabilities. Codenvy is a free IDE for Linux that gives programmers the option of having public or private workspaces. Workspace owners in Codenvy, a free IDE for Linux, can select the type of privacy mode and determine which users have administrative or write privileges to the workspace. They can accomplish this a cloud-based free IDE for Linux has virtually none of the limitations of its desktop equivalents. This is especially true for Codenvy. </p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
