<h1>Eclipse Alternative Cloud IDE for Java</h1>

<hr class="subtitle-line">

<p>Many developers have expressed frustration over the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment utilizing Eclipse and other desktop IDEs. Codenvy makes a great Eclipse alternative. </p>
<p>Desktop IDEs like Eclipse are essentially mini data centers that are operated by developers, sucking up time and effort that should be spent programming. A full code, test, and build environment often means the developers have to maintain multiple components and software systems. A recent study showed that developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering desktop IDEs like Eclipse. </p>
<p>Eclipse alternatives, on the other hand, give programmers a break from this work by handling most of these time-consuming tasks. Thanks to Eclipse alternatives like Codenvy, developers are able to spend less time administering their desktops, and more time programming. Using an Eclipse alternative gave them greater functionality, flexibility and customization opportunity.</p><p>Our Current Supported Technologies and Platforms Include:</p>
