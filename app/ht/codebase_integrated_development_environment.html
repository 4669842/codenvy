<h1> Codebase Integrated Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Desktop IDEs find it difficult to connect to cloud databases, which can often change the overall accessibility and efficacy of a programmer. Codenvy is the best Codebase integrated development environment developers can turn to in their time of need to connect to multiple systems through the cloud and engage with the future of programming.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are unilaterally stuck on the desktop they exist upon, which means that any connection to the cloud is virtually useless. Without that access to the cloud, or even with the limited access you might be able to get, there's no way a programmer can achieve everything that is possible in the current day and age of programming. They just can't keep up, and it's beginning to show in ways that are both embarrassing and potentially company-altering, if companies fail to recognize how they can manage to incorporate the shifting landscape into their workflows.</p>
<p>Codebase integrated development environments are exactly what a development-oriented company needs to wave goodbye to the past and hello to the cloud of the present. Codebase integrated development environments like Codenvy can connect to cloud datasources, code management repositories, maven central, and PaaS systems. There's simply no question that a Codebase integrated development environment can go places a desktop IDE can't. At the end of the day, that's what's going to keep a development-reliant company afloat or sink it to the bottom.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>

  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
