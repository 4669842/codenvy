<h1>Deveo Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>You'd be lucky to get a response to an inquiry to a desktop IDE development team about specific issues. Codenvy is the best Deveo development environment precisely because our support team is responsive and committed to providing their users with the absolute best coding environment possible.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs aren't known for providing the best user support. In fact, it's quite common that a desktop IDE's comment and concerns from its user base may go completely unnoticed or be disregarded entirely. Sometimes bug fixes that seem simple and have been harped upon for years go unaddressed for no apparent reason. This lack of attention to the needs of their user base is precisely the outmoded approach to client services that doom desktop IDEs to a swift defeat in the near future.</p>
<p>Deveo development environments based in the cloud aren't satisfied with this level of so-called support. Deveo development environments like Codenvy are committed to providing responsive email support that is both courteous and professional. With a Deveo development environment like Codenvy, developers can rest assured that their support system will not rest until their workspaces are configured perfectly and are issue free.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<a href="{{'../index.html' | url}}" class="blue-button button-400">Embrace the Best Cloud-Based IDE</a>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
