<h1>Gitorious Integrated Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Around the world, developers are chanting their disdain for needing to use desktop IDEs as their primary programming environment. Desktop IDEs present significant hurdles to accomplishing tasks in a timely manner, and are not easy to use. Codenvy is the best Gitorious integrated development environment that functions as a proper and desirable alternative to desktop IDEs.</p>
<p>It's not difficult to understand where these developers' frustrations are coming from. After all, using a desktop IDE means that you, as an individual, are responsible for administering and managing the environment yourself. This includes handling installation and maintenance of features and plugins. You can imagine how much of a time suck this can be. Indeed, a recent study has suggested that developers can spend up to one-third of their time just taking care of the various components and software systems in the desktop IDE. That's 13 hours a week that could otherwise be used to program.</p>
<p>Gitorious integrated development environments are capable of providing significant benefits with virtually none of the significant negative characteristics of desktop IDEs. A notable feature of Codenvy, an incredible Gitorious integrated development environment, is that is provides datasource bindings. Developers can bind datasources to their Codenvy projects and enjoy a secure connection to a variety of databases. Codenvy takes care of configuring the datasources, inserting them into the configuration files, and testing the connections. A Gitorious integrated development environment like Codenvy can change the way developers thing about their jobs. And really, isn't that how innovation happens?</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>

  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
