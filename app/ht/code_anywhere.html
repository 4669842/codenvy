	<hr class="subtitle-line">

	<p>Codenvy addresses multiple needs in the end-to-end cloud development
	workflow.  But developers virtually "live" in the editor/IDE, so having
	a complete and powerful IDE that allows developers to code anywhere, either as an individual or a team, is essential to project success.
	</p>
	<p>The Codenvy IDE knows web development language syntax, formatting and 
		nuances.  The Codenvy IDE supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, for code anywhere / any-platform projects. And we are adding more PaaS support continuously.
		
		Our IDE revolutionize technical workbenches by leveraging cloudâ€™s collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.  We strive for simplicity, efficiency and productivity.
	</p>
	<p>In fact, the Codenvy code anywhere IDE is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it
	for all our own in-house development.  i.e, Codenvy is written using the Codenvy
IDE.
