<h1>Pricing FAQ</h1>
<h2>Additional details on the finer points of our pricing</h2>


<h3>You have a $1 special promotion!  How is that possible and what are the terms?!?</h3>
<p>Yes, for a limited time we have a special promotion.  We are offering our Secure subscription, which retails for $9 / month USD, with an $8 / month discount.   We are offering this subscription at a rate that is below our cost given the new nature of our offering and to offer a “Thank You” to our early adopters.  This  promotion can be revoked at any time, but we will provide  subscribers with a 2 month notice before it’s discontinuation, at which point the monthly rate of $9 / month USD will commence.  There is no penalty for a downgrade of an account to our free offering.   Taxes and other charges are based upon the list price and incurred at the time of purchase.</p>

<h3>What’s the difference between Premium & Business?</h3>
<p>The Business subscription contains an organization profile that is managed from your personal account. Organizations are suited for businesses who need to manage permissions for many employees.</p>

<p>User accounts are intended for humans, but you can give one to a robot if you need.  Every person that uses Codenvy needs  to create their own user account. If you're making an account for a business, create your personal user first, then make an organization account.   The Secure and Premium accounts offer unlimited public repositories and coders, can upgrade to a Business account, and can only have a single owner.</p>

<p>Organization accounts, which are available in our Business subscription, are for businesses and open source projects that need multiple owners and administrators.  Any user can be a member of an organization regardless of what plan the user is on. Users can also join many organizations.  Organization accounts add on team-based permissions  (owner, admin) along with multiple owners and administrators.  Additionally, we enable receipts to be sent to a second email address to support your procurement process.</p>

<h3>What is Continuous, Incremental Build and Deployment?</h3>
<p>Codenvy is working on an embedded process for speeding up the time that it takes code to be compiled, packaged, and loaded into the runtime container.  These capabilities are in various stages of implementation and will be made available for Premium and Business subscribers.   For a limited period, we will be offering these capabilities free to all of our accounts.   Our objective is to have code compiled, packaged, and deployed into the test VM before the coder has requested these actions to occur.  This process is patent-pending and will be elaborated in white papers that will ship when we have these features introduced for beta.</p>
