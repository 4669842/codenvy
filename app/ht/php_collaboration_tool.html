<h1>PHP Collaboration Tool</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Many developers have expressed frustration over the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment utilizing desktop IDEs. Codenvy is the best php collaboration tool for developers to leave those frustrations behind.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are basically miniature data centers developers have to operate, which takes up valuable time and effort they could otherwise spend programming. A comprehensive code, test, and build environment usually requires the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. </p>
<p>php collaboration tools, on the other hand, give programmers a break from this work by handling most of these time-consuming tasks. php collaboration tools like Codenvy let developers spend less time administering their desktops and more time programming. They can accomplish this because they switched to a php collaboration tool that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
