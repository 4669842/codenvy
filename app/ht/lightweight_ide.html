<h1>Lightweight IDE</h1>

<hr class="subtitle-line">

<p>Many developers have expressed frustration over the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment utilizing desktop IDEs. Codenvy is the best web-based lightweight IDE for developers to leave those frustrations behind.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs work as miniature data centers developers have to operate, which takes up valuable time and effort they could instead use to program. A comprehensive code, test, and build environment usually requires the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. A recent study showed that developers spend around one-third of their work time administering their desktop IDE, time they should use elsewhere.</p>
<p>Lightweight IDEs, on the other hand, give programmers a break from this work by dealing with most of these time-consuming tasks for them. Web-based lightweight IDEs like Codenvy allow developers to spend less time administering their desktops and more time programming. They can accomplish this because they switched to a lightweight IDE that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization.</p><p>Our Current Supported Technologies and Platforms Include:</p>
