<h1>GitHub IDE Integration Tool</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Desktop IDEs don't offer much in the way of helping manage the dependencies developers need to perform their job adequately. Codenvy is the best tool for GitHub IDE Integration that also offers outstanding dependency management options.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs could probably be more ill suited to the needs of the contemporary developer, but it certainly is also far from optimal. The unwieldy and unintuitive organization of the many facets of a desktop IDE, including its components and software systems, create an untenable situation that developers should not have to deal with. They require constant attention and care the likes of which should not be placed on the shoulders of each individual programmer. A recent study says that these men and women can spend up to one third of their workweek taking care of these ancillary issues, an outrageous statistic. <br>
</p>
<p>A tool for GitHub IDE Integration, when in the cloud, can provide advantages not available to desktop IDE users. For example, a tool for GitHub IDE Integration like Codenvy provides outstanding dependency management. Codenvy allows users to automatically download necessary dependencies and handle circular and multi-module dependencies. Using a tool for GitHub IDE integration like Codenvy can allow you to add a new dependency to maven and will handle all additional issues from there. It's a fantastic feature that is representative of Codenvy's approach to solving developers' problems.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
