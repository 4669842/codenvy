<h1>PHP partner</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Many developers demonstrate exasperation at the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment with a desktop IDE. Codenvy is the best PHP partner for developers to leave those frustrations behind.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are essentially miniature data centers developers have to operate in order to program. This takes up valuable time and effort that should be spent programming. There are multiple components and software systems that make up a full code, test, and build environment. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE, or just making sure these many features remain functional. </p>
<p>A PHP partner, on the other hand, give programmers a break from this work by handling most of these time-consuming tasks. A PHP partner like Codenvy lets developers spend less time administering their desktops and more time programming. With the greater amount of customization, flexibility and functionality at their disposal, developers will fall in love with a PHP partner.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
