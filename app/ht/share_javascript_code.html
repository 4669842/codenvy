<h1>Share Javascript code </h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Many developers have expressed frustration over the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment utilizing desktop IDEs. Codenvy is the best tool to share Javascript code for developers to leave those frustrations behind.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are basically miniature data centers developers have to operate, which takes up valuable time and effort they could otherwise spend programming. A comprehensive code, test, and build environment usually requires the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. </p>
<p>A tool that sees to it that developers can share Javascript code, on the other hand, give programmers a break by taking on the majority of these time-consuming tasks. A tool that allows them to share Javascript code, like Codenvy, let developers spend less time administering their desktops and more time programming. They can accomplish this because they switched to a tool that provides for an ability to share Javascript code that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
