<h1>Amazon Web Servives Integration IDE</h1>

<hr class="subtitle-line">

<p>When we talk to developers, many express frustration over the difficulty and complexity of administering a development environment through desktop IDEs. Thatâ€™s why we developed a stellar alternative. Codenvy is the best Amazon Web Servives Integration IDE for developers to get around those pitfalls.</p>
  <p>Desktop IDEs operate as mini data centers developers watch over. This essentially wastes prized time and effort that could otherwise spend programming. A complete code, test, and build environment will typically require the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. A recent study showed that developers might spend up to one-third of their time administering desktop IDEs. </p>
  <p>Amazon Web Servives Integration IDEs, on the other hand, liberate programmers by handling most of these time-consuming tasks. Amazon Web Servives Integration IDEs like Codenvy let developers spend less time administering their desktops and more time doing real work. They can accomplish this due to the fact that they have switched to an Amazon Web Servives Integration IDE that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
