<hr class="subtitle-line">

<p>Many developers have expressed frustration over the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment utilizing desktop IDEs. Codenvy is the best web IDE for developers to leave those frustrations behind.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are basically mini data centers that are operated by developers, requiring valuable time and effort that could be spent programming. A full code, test, and build environment often requires the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. </p>
<p>Cloud codes give programmers a break from this work by taking care of most of these time-consuming tasks. Cloud codes like Codenvy allow developers to spend less time administering their desktops, and more time programming. Switching to a cloud code provides them with greater functionality, flexibility and customization.</p><p>Our Current Supported Technologies and Platforms Include:</p>
