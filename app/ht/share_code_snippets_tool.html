<h1>Share code snippets tool</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Many developers show frustration at how difficult and complex maintaining a development environment using a desktop IDE can be. Codenvy is the best tool to share code snippets for developers to mitigate those frustrations altogether.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are miniature data centers developers operate with minimal help and assistance, which steals valuable time and effort that could otherwise be used to program. A full code, test, and build environment usually obliges the maintenance and preservation of numerous components and software systems. A late study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. </p>
<p>Tools that let developers share code snippets, on the other hand, give programmers a break from this work by handling most of these tasks that create inefficiency. Share code snippets tools like Codenvy allow developers to spend less time administering their desktops and more time programming, where they want to be spending their time. They can accomplish this great accomplishment because they switched to a tool that lets them share code snippets and provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization.
</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>
