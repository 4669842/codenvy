<h1>Collaborative IDE</h1>

<hr class="subtitle-line">

<p>Many developers have expressed frustration over the difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment utilizing desktop IDEs. Codenvy is the best Collaborative IDE for developers to leave those frustrations behind.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are basically miniature data centers developers have to operate, which takes up valuable time and effort they could otherwise spend programming. A comprehensive code, test, and build environment usually requires the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their time administering their desktop IDE. </p>
<p>Collaborative IDEs, on the other hand, give programmers a break from this work by handling most of these time-consuming tasks. Collaborative IDEs like Codenvy let developers spend less time administering their desktops and more time programming. Developers accomplish this by switching to a collaborative IDE that gives them greater functionality, flexibility and customization.</p><p>Our Current Supported Technologies and Platforms Include:</p>
