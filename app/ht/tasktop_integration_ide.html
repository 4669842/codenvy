<h1>Tasktop Integration IDE</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>The difficulty and complexity of maintaining a development environment utilizing desktop IDEs can be a big nuisance for developers. We developed Codenvy to mitigate these issues. Codenvy is the best Tasktop Integration IDE for developers to leave those frustrations behind.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are essentially miniature data centers developers have to operate themselves, taking away precious time and effort that could otherwise be used programming. A full code, test, and build environment usually requires the maintenance and upkeep of multiple components and software systems. A recent study has shown that developers can spend up to one-third of their work time administering their desktop IDE. What an outrageously high number.</p>
<p>A Tasktop Integration IDE, on the other hand, gives programmers their time back by taking care of these tough tasks behind the scenes. A Tasktop Integration IDEs like Codenvy lets developers spend less time administering desktops and more time programming, which is what their job should be focused on. They can fulfill these needs because they have turned to a Tasktop Integration IDE that provides greater functionality, flexibility and customization.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
