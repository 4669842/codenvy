<h1>Free Linux IDE</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Desktop IDEs are less than stellar when it comes to introducing outstanding – or even necessary – features for developers to improve their experience. Codenvy is the best Free Linux IDEbecause, among others things, it makes cloning a workspace as easy as Github makes cloning a repository.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are basically miniaturized data centers that require constant care and attention to ensure that they remain operational. Their myriad components and software systems can require up to one third of a developer's time at work just to be properly administered and maintained. It's little wonder that this type of IDE is on its way out. </p>
<p>A free Linux IDE like Codenvy prides itself not only on its relative ease of use, but also on its inventive approaches to solving programming problems. As mentioend above, as a cloud-based free Linux IDE, Codenvy makes cloning a workspace an intuitive process. Developers' application, code, configuration, and runtime are all cloned together. Developers who instantiate a Factory using the free Linux IDE Codenvy are placed in an anonymous, temporary, and fully functional workspace isolated from permanent objects. This is just one of the many reasons why a free Linux IDE like Codenvy can change the way developers approach development.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
