	<h1>Codenvy Compared with Eclipse Orion</h1>

	<hr class="subtitle-line">

	<p>Like many developers, we cut our teeth using Eclipse.  We love the extensibility
	and power of Eclipse, as well as the focus on open standards.
	When we set out to build Codenvy, we built on what we love about Eclipse and added
	practical Cloud-Platform features for real-world development projects.
	Codenvy addresses multiple needs in the end-to-end cloud development
	workflow.  But developers virtually "live" in the editor/IDE, so having
	a complete and powerful Web Based Development Environment is essential to project success.  Unlike Orion, which is building a generalized framework, Codenvy is currently more commercially complete, faster and has broader PaaS support.
	</p>
	<p>The Codenvy IDE knows language syntax, formatting and 
		nuances.  The Web Based Development Environment supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously.
		
		Our IDE revolutionize technical workbenches by leveraging cloudâ€™s collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.  We strive for simplicity, efficiency and productivity.
	</p>
	<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web Based Development Environment is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it
	for all our own in-house Java development.  i.e, Codenvy is written using the Codenvy
IDE.
