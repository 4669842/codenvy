<h1> Beanstalk Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>When you're putting together or participating in a hackathon, you don't want to be dragged down by the limitations of a desktop IDE. Codenvy is the best Beanstalk development environment for developers participating in hackathons to bring their team together and collaborate to accomplish something truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>If you've participated in a hackathon before, you understand how incredibly limiting a desktop IDE can be when trying to coordinate team efforts. With all of the additional pieces of the coding environment that require attention, getting down to hacking can be a struggle. If the average developer spends one-third of her workweek just taking care of their desktop[ IDE, you can only imagine how limiting a statistic like this can be for a hackathon team.</p>
<p>Beanstalk development environments are the preferred hackathon environments for programmers looking to get a leg up on their competition. Beanstalk development environments like Codenvy can automate project creation and sharing with simply URL formats. This helps programmers spend less time getting around to hacking and more time actually hacking away. They can accomplish this because a Beanstalk development environment is just that cool.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
