	<h1>Develop Mobile Apps Online Using HTML5</h1>

	<hr class="subtitle-line">

	<p>Codenvy addresses multiple needs in the end-to-end cloud development
	workflow.  And the hottest area of cloud development today is mobile apps. Developers virtually "live" in the editor/IDE, so having
	a complete and powerful Online HTML5 and CSS Editor (in addition to multiple other web languages) is essential to project success.  Unlike device specific mobile SDKs, Codenvy can help develop mobile apps online using the new universal standard: HTML5.  While some device specific hardware controls may require device SDKs, most mobile apps are actually better when developed in pure HTML5.  Why?  Mobile SDKs are often not perfect when it comes to variations across multiple vendors; HTML5 is far more standardized than mobile SDKs.  In addition, HTML5 is as close as you can get to "write once, run anywhere" code for mobile apps.
	</p>
	<p>The Codenvy Online HTML Editor knows HTML5 and CSS syntax, formatting and language
		nuances.  The Online HTML IDE supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously.
		
		Our complete HTML/CSS IDE revolutionize technical workbenches by leveraging cloudâ€™s collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.  We strive for simplicity, efficiency and productivity.
	</p>
	<p>In fact, the Codenvy Online IDE is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it
	for all our own in-house development.  i.e, Codenvy is written using the Codenvy IDE.
