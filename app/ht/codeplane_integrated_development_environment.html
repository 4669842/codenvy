<h1> Codeplane Integrated Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>The problem enterprise customers face when working with desktop IDEs is that they are too small-scale for their coding needs. If they're looking for an environment they can have complete control over, they want something they can administer on their premises while still having the utmost of coding capabilities. Codenvy is the best Codeplane integrated development environment enterprise customers can purchase in order to both maintain their own on-premises cloud without giving up the advantages of coding in the cloud. </p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are embarrassingly limited in what they allow enterprise teams to accomplish. Because developers are responsible for maintaining their own coding environment, they must sacrifice a huge amount of team unity for little reason. Enterprise clients in search of a solution can't continue using these traditional development environments; it simply doesn't make sense to keep trying.</p>
<p>Codeplane integrated development environments based in the cloud can offer a powerful alternative by being both easier to maintain onsite and more intuitive for developers to use on a daily basis. Codeplane integrated development environments like Codenvy allow enterprise clients to bring their own hardware into the equation to operate as a private cloud environment that can be scaled to any specifications. With a Codeplane integrated development environment based in the cloud, enterprise clients can install and manage Codenvy behind their firewall, control access to their code, and provision workspaces to global teams.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>

<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
