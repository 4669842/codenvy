<h1>GitHub Integrated Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Developers and the companies that employ them are often frustrated at the impossibility of programming that is derived from how much extra work and time these types of development environments require. Codenvy, the best GitHub integrated development environment for developers, provides features like remote libraries that not only set it apart from desktop IDEs, but also set it apart from its cloud-based competition.</p>
<p>Desktop IDEs are physically limited, as well as limited quantitatively, in how much support they are able to offer. They are severely limited in part because they require a high level of maintenance, installation, and oversight from the developers using them on their individual machines. All this extra work can take up to one-third of the developers' time from them. Combined with the inaccessibility of desktop IDEs from other machines, it makes sense that the industry would move toward a more contemporary solution.</p>
<p>GitHub integrated development environments provide exactly the type of support and feature-rich environment developers dream of having, with virtually none of the traditional drawbacks. Codenvy, a GitHub integrated development environment nonpareil, allows application to use libraries with artifacts that are stored remotely, like in Maven Central. Developers who use Codenvy as their Github integrated development environment can also publish libraries created in Codenvy directly to external repositories. With Codenvy, there's no question that a cloud-based Github integrated development environment is the primary solution to the quandary presented by the need to program and the unacceptability of desktop IDEs.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>
  <li>Easy Setup</li>
  <li>Configure Once, Invite Many</li>
  <li>Run &amp; Test</li>
  <li>Complete Build Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Pair (or more) Programming</li>
  <li>Powerful  Editor</li>
  <li>PaaS Deployment</li>
  <li>Codenvy Factory</li>
  <li>Your Tools, Your Way</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As a cloud-based IDE, </em>Codenvy eliminates many of the costs of maintaining a desktop development environment.</p>
<p>Codenvy knows Java syntax, formatting and language nuances. As a cloud IDE for Java, it supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously. </p>

<p>Codenvy revolutionizes technical workbenches by leveraging the cloud's collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.</p>
<p>In fact, the Codenvy Web IDE for Java is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it for all our own in-house Java development.</p>
