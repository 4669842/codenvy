<h1>Assembla Development Environment</h1>
<hr class="subtitle-line">
<p>Using a desktop IDE as their primary workbench has made many a developer frustrated and forlorn. Codenvy is the best Assembla development environment for developers to turn to as their primary workbench and build anywhere, on any device, at any time.</p>
<p>Using a desktop IDE as your primary workbench is extremely limiting. In addition to requiring additional maintenance and upkeep, a desktop IDE is tied to a physical location. A comprehensive code, test, and build environment requires such a wide variety of components and software that a developer is not only tied to one spot, but is also required to spend exorbitant amounts of time taking care of their environment. It's a bad situation all around. </p>
<p>Assembla development environments are the preferred primary workbench for developers who have been around the block. Assembla development environments like Codenvy are both mobile and agile: they let developers code anywhere, anytime, from any console. Whether working alone or as part of a team, an Assembla development environment can meet you wherever you need to be.</p><p>Codenvy is a full-featured platform that provides:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>No Download</li>

<p>There are 4 direct costs to managing a desktop IDE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Merge</li>
  <li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
